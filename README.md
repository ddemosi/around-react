# Around the U.S. Project AROUND-REACT (Project 11)!
--------------------------------
### A "not as simple as it once was" ReactJS project for the Web Dev program at Practicum by Yandex

Mostly there:

* Couldn't figure out how to get the form validation set up. I didn't see it on the project requirement checklist, so I didn't finish adding it. Weird errors between JSX and vanilla, I think.
* I did get the "confirm delete popup" working, as well as the loading icons.
* Needs more cowbell
