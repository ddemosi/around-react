# Around the U.S. Project AROUND-REACT (Project 10)!
--------------------------------
### A "not as simple as it once was" ReactJS project for the Web Dev program at Practicum by Yandex

Mostly there:
* Website is now partially ported to react. Viewable, but not very interactive yet.
* State management is a mess, lol. It's going to take me a bit to figure it out.
* Getting there, slowly but surely!

Draft 2:
* Cleaned up the state variables. Significantly less code being passed between components.
* Removed pages folder
* Moved popups to App.js
* Moved App component to the components folder
* Deleted public from the .gitignore file, lol
* Misc bug fixes

Created with ReactJS

### Enjoy!
